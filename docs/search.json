Cities like Amster- dam show that change is possible: Amsterdam moved from car-centric design and urban planning in the 1970s to the capital of the now famously bicycle-friendly Netherlands. Paris improved its air quality and quality of live focusing on multi- modal modes like cycling and walking in combina- tion with a strong public transport by extending cycling infrastructure, bike sharing (…) The ques- tions is how to achieve a transformation in cities? How do we ensure a high acceptability of the mea- sure by politics and the public? Which goals do we actually target and which constraints need to be considered? Here, it becomes clear that the trans- formational approaches are and must be country- and city-specific with context-specific rules, laws, habits, and history. We want to know how best practices can be implemented world-wide. For this, we need to understand the soil in which the best practices must be planted, meaning the spe- cific situation of a city/country. When we know which soil we have (meaning which target and con- straints an area has), we can build robust and adaptable frameworks and choose fitting methods for the urban transformation to be implemented. Comparisons between countries are an especially suited method to uncover differences and similari- ties which might otherwise stay invisible as status quo.\n\n\n2 Methods\nIn Figure 1, you can see the overall structure of this research project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Methdologgy overview of this research project (Find the original version here)\n\n\n\nResults {#sec-results}\n\n\n3 Discussion\n\n\n4 References\n\n\n\n\nReuseCC BY-SA 4.0Copyright© 2025 Robin Lovelace",
